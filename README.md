# Made with
This app is made with MySQL and Sequelize for the database. Passport.js and BCrypt for user information. It also leverages JavaScript, JQuery, and Handlebars.js. The app is hosted on Heroku and uses JawsDB.

# test login
username - test
password - 123

It will function to create an account, but because it is hosted for free on Heroky with JawsDB, it runs very slow and I advise just using the test login information.
